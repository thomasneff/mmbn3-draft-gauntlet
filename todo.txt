Entities. Add all the info from TREZ.








Get all virus breeder viruses in the save game so the chips don't puff.

Implement folder sorting in rendering. (Simply use start to toggle through Alpha/Code/ID/Damage)
Render current folder chip in upper-right corner. (Possibly needs smaller chip BG)

Possibly implement images for buffs? Would implement simply as chip_id and render a chip.

Implement Chip drops.

Implement better battle progression (split into easy, medium, hard viruses, with t1, t2, t3, t4, possibly t5)

Implement reasonable start folder randomization?



Find out how to change number of chips in Cust Screen.
Find out how to change cust gauge speed.


Find out Boomer PanelGrab offset.
Find out Swordy AreaGrab offset.
Find out Pengi IceStage offset. <-- this should be easy, as I don't remember any other virus/navi using IceStage.


Possibly implement a system to create fixed fights the game can choose from. Should contain ENTITIES, BACKGROUND, STAGE.



TODO:
Chip Data defs, index to Name, Chip Icon, Chip Image, address for codes, damage
we automatically patch over it at the start with those values


contain drop tables for chips, 
map from chance to list of chips with codes?

ChipGenerator.GetChipWithSpecificCodeIfExists(CHIPS.ShockWav, CHIP_CODE.A) -- this either returns a chip with code A if it exists, or non-asterisk otherwise.

-- If there are only asterisk (for whatever reason) just return asterisk.
60 =  ChipGenerator.GetChipListNonAsterisk(CHIPS.ShockWav) -- this returns copies of the shockwav chip with all non-asterisk codes, which contains address, index, etc., to put into folder

80 =  ChipGenerator.GetChipAsterisk(CHIPS.Guard) -- should also return a list with a single entry.

95 = ChipGenerator.GetChipAsterisk(CHIPS.ShockWav)

100 = ChipGenerator.GetChipListNonAsterisk(CHIPS.SonicWav)
