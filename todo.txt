TODO:
Chip Data defs, index to Name, Chip Icon, Chip Image, address for codes, damage
we automatically patch over it at the start with those values


entity groups with customization:
We need a rising difficulty curve inside each gauntlet as well. 
Therefore we either need to bind the battle count min and max as well as the round to the virus, or create more complex entity groups ourselves
maybe we should just get rid of the "round" and do entity groups for each fight, automatically assembled?


Entities will contain flags for regular, miniboss, boss
contain ranges for when they can appear (battle, no need for rounds)

contain drop tables for chips, 
map from chance to list of chips with codes?

60 =  ChipGenerator.GetChipListNonAsterisk(CHIPS.ShockWav) -- this returns copies of the shockwav chip with all non-asterisk codes, which contains address, index, etc., to put into folder

80 =  ChipGenerator.GetChipAsterisk(CHIPS.Guard)

95 = ChipGenerator.GetChipAsterisk(CHIPS.ShockWav)

100 = ChipGenerator.GetChipListNonAsterisk(CHIPS.SonicWav)


For drafting, we need to have state - during "DRAFT-STATE", we need to wait for and validate user-input (user needs to click on a chip, then replace one from the folder)
For easier implementation, the replace screen contains a "throw away" button.

Same system for choosing roguelike bonuses.
Upon choosing a chip and the folder index to replace it with, we mod it into the folder and unpause until the next battle.
