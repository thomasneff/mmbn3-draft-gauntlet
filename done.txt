Implement AI byte patching

Implement per-battle patching, so we can pre-define all battles and just patch one-by-one
 - Changed battle patching to now be per-battle. This removes the need of pointer adjustment.
 - We simply patch each battle as it comes, and use the existing offsets :-)

Implement a system that forces battles 5 and 10 to be single-enemy. (probably some flag in GAUNTLET_DEFS)
